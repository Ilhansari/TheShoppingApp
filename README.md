# TheShoppingApp

## Brief Description About Architecture and Approach

In this project, networking and UI extension modules were separated with a modular structure. This is because of cost-effective, speed of build, testability and flexibility of use. In addition, the networking layer is an independent module. We can use this module also for MacOS platform. The app develop by focusing on MVVM + Delegate pattern. It would be useful and easy to extend it to handle errors, limit data fetching, etc. I didn't use any dependencies in my project.

# Third-party dependencies
